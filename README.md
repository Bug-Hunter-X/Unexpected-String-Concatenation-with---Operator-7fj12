This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug caused by the language's loose typing system and the behavior of the + operator. The bug showcases how using the + operator with a mix of numbers and strings leads to string concatenation instead of the expected numerical addition.  The solution provides a corrected version with explicit type checking to prevent this unexpected behavior.
